My name is Alan Penrod and I am a junior software developer who graduated from Tech Elevator in December 2024.

In college I created interactive digital elements for websites and social media using the Adobe Creative Suite. I took programming courses, using HTML and CSS to develop webpages. This piqued my curiosity into how web applications work. I completed independent courses on Java which led me to Tech Elevator. My goal is to land an entry level software developer role.
